BICYCLE FRAME 


1. Introduction of Idea
Our idea is a a simple process flow, beginning with our usage of a universal platform in the form of Google Forms.
The user-inputted data from the Google Form is automatically generated in a corresponding Google Sheet page. This will 
display all the data that is necessary even under the current sign-up requirements on Food Bank Singapore's page. This 
information can then be downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet and loaded through with our system, which will then seek 
to sort through the names based on a set list of criteria. In our demonstration unit, we only considered the basic criteria
of the category of jobs the participants were interested in - generating name lists for dates they were interested in (in case
the administration staff wanted to make manual adjustments to the schedule) and also for the jobs they wanted to do (if applicable). 
This can be expanded to include the number of volunteers required, the consideration of people intending to participate together etc.
Regardless of the criteria stipulated by the administration staff, our system ultimately aims to follow this 4-step process:
	a. Finalise role of volunteers
	b. Sort them into relevant excel sheets for their roles given stipulated restrictions
	c. Pinpoint who is available based on dates indicated
	d. Generate a schedule based on available information  



2. Basis of Idea
We operated on the basis of the K.I.S.S. principle - to Keep It Simple and Succinct. Essentially, we wanted our system to be 
similar to a bicycle frame that can be easily built on top of. We hoped that by utilising Excel as our main platform for our endeavour, 
it would not only allow for the ease of modification, but also to serve as a continued learning opportunity that we can learn from as we 
continue to explore on the subject matter (even after the event) as we expect Excel to be a mainstay in similar processes going forward.
